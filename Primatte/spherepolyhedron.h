/**
  * This class constructs, stores and manages a carefully-constructed 3D spherical
  * polyhedron. Here is how it works:
  * Construction:
  * If the top and bottom triangle rings are ignored, then the polyhedron
  * can be represented as a 2D grid of vertices indexed by angles. This makes
  * face lookup really fast. The top/bottom areas can then be treated as edge cases.
  * Thus, first the 2D grid is constructed, and then the two poles are inserted.
  * Adjacent vertices may be found quickly by storing the vertices in a grid order.
  * Triangle inersection:
  * The appropriate quad is first selected. A quad is made from two triangles:
  * the equation of the line is used to determine which trinagle a ray falls into.
  * The triangle is then chosen, and the distance to the plane lying on the triangle is found.
  * One limitation is that the ray origin must be the sphere origin, and the sphere vertices
  * may not be moved as to violate the angle between them and the origin.
